# UFO Finder

## Overview of Project
Create interactive dashboard that allows users to explore UFO sightings data by date, location, and shape.

## Results
1.  To filter these results, enter a **Date**, **City**, **State**, **Country**, or **Shape**.
2.  Once you have entered a filter criteria press **Enter** on keyboard or select another filter criteria. 

**Note**: If you do not see results after filtering that means no results based on current dataset and/or filter(s). You can try filtering again or refresh the webpage. To better understand your filter options, please review the list before entering filter criteria.

## Summary
This is a great v1, offering the desired interactivity but it has a few opportunities:
 - Limited dataset, we should open this up for user contribution
 - Open text filter criteria leads to zero result sets, we should implement structure for our filters
 - Add notification of new sightings in general or by specific criteria helping corroborate/group sightings
